# DenseViT-XGB: A Hybrid Approach for Dates Varieties Identification

This repository contains the implementation of DenseViT-XGB, a hybrid approach for identifying dates varieties using a combination of Dense Vision Transformer (DenseViT) and XGBoost (XGB) algorithms.

## Introduction

Identifying different varieties of dates is essential for quality control and market segmentation in the dates industry. This project presents a novel hybrid approach that combines the strengths of DenseViT, a powerful computer vision model, with XGBoost, a popular gradient boosting algorithm, to accurately classify dates varieties based on images.
